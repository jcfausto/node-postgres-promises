# node-postgres-promises

Experimental API for building new skills.

Started with pg_promises but now I'm using it to experiment new things and improve my knowledge about the Javascript's ecosystem.

Using:
- Yarn
- Nodejs
- Express
- JSHint
- Knex

## To Do

- Refactor the project structure.
- Check the configs to separate from the app's logic (12 factor app guidelines)
- Add Tests - Will use Jest probably. (Should have started this way since the beginning :-)
- Add authentication using JWT
- Containerize the app to run on Docker (including being able to run the tests on Docker)
